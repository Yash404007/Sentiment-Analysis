# Sentiment Analysis using RoBERTa and Transformer Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa model and the Transformers library. The goal is to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using a pre-trained RoBERTa model.

## Features

- Utilizes the Hugging Face `transformers` library for ease of implementation.
- Pre-trained RoBERTa model for state-of-the-art sentiment analysis.
- Processes input text and provides sentiment labels with confidence scores.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sentiment-analysis-roberta.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-roberta
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the Requirements section.

3. **Run the Script**:

   Execute the script to analyze sentiment:

   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

4. **Sample Code**:

   Below is an example of how to use the Transformers pipeline for sentiment analysis:

   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline

   # Load pre-trained sentiment-analysis pipeline
   sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="roberta-base")

   # Input text
   texts = [
       "I love this product! It's amazing!",
       "This is the worst experience I've ever had.",
       "It's okay, not great but not terrible either."
   ]

   # Analyze sentiment
   results = sentiment_pipeline(texts)

   for text, result in zip(texts, results):
       print(f"Text: {text}\nSentiment: {result['label']} (Confidence: {result['score']:.2f})\n")
   ```

├── sentiment_analysis.py  # Main script for sentiment analysis
├── README.md              # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt       # Required Python dependencies
```

## Results

- Sentiment analysis provides labels such as `POSITIVE`, `NEGATIVE`, or `NEUTRAL`.
- Outputs confidence scores to indicate the model's certainty.

Example output:

```plaintext
Text: I love this product! It's amazing!
Sentiment: POSITIVE (Confidence: 0.99)

Text: This is the worst experience I've ever had.
Sentiment: NEGATIVE (Confidence: 0.98)

Text: It's okay, not great but not terrible either.
Sentiment: NEUTRAL (Confidence: 0.75)
```

## Customization

- **Model**: You can replace `roberta-base` with other fine-tuned RoBERTa models or custom models available on the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).
- **Pipeline Parameters**: Adjust the pipeline parameters to modify performance, batch size, or device configuration.
